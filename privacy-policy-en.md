Last updated: 2026-01-20

This Privacy Policy describes how the Alexa skill “Adhan (Ezan) Assistant” handles data.

## What data is processed?

Depending on your use and granted permissions, the skill may process:

1. **Device Address (optional, permission required)**
   - If you grant “Device Address (full)” permission, the skill may use it to detect country and (if available) city to calculate accurate prayer times.

2. **Reminders (optional, permission required)**
   - If you grant “Reminders” permission, the skill can create, update, or remove prayer time reminders.
   - Without this permission, the skill **cannot** create reminders.

3. **Skill Settings (configuration)**
   - The skill stores settings such as language, country, city, calculation method, and reminder options so you don’t have to enter them again.

4. **Technical usage logs**
   - Amazon may provide technical logs (e.g., timestamps, error codes). These are used only to troubleshoot and improve reliability.

## How is the data used?

- To calculate and present prayer times
- To create/manage reminders (only with permission)
- To apply your saved preferences (language, location, method)
- To troubleshoot and improve the skill

## Data sharing

- **Amazon Alexa** processes requests and manages permissions (e.g., address, reminders).
- The skill may call a **prayer times API** to retrieve times. Only necessary parameters (e.g., city/country, method, date) are sent.
- Your data is **not sold**.

## Storage and retention

- Skill settings are stored while you use the skill or until you reset them.
- Reminders are stored in your Amazon account and can be removed anytime.
- You can reset settings and remove reminders via the skill or Alexa app.

## Your choices

You can revoke permissions anytime in the Alexa app:

- Device Address (full)
- Reminders
